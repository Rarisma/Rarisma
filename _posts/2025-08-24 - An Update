Hello,

Just a few updates:

The URL for this site is now blog.rarisma.net and the Rarisma/SiteTest Repo is now archived, the source for this site is now Rarisma/Rarisma.
This site going forward will be the main public presence for stuff I do.
Additionally I will be trying to find any old repos that have github pages stuff lying around and move it here.

### HEY! Where are my promised blog posts
Okay, yeah I've been busy.

Originally around April-May I did have a planned blog post. However *certain* external pressures stopped me from turning this into a
fully polished and released blog post from its original rough draft. Then exams happened and I also kinda went backpacking.

But in the past month I've gotten really into self-hosting and degoogle stuff so I plan to publish a few blog posts on that.

I also have a few projects approaching release within the next four to six weeks and I want to write about those too.
If you want a hint on what the first post on this will be then I must ask how do you sort 25,000 images and videos?
