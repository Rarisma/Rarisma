### Who owns firehose?
Firehose is a project created by Rarisma and aims to make being informed take much less time by aggregating and summarising news articles.
Firehose is entirely self funded.

Firehose does not own the rights to any articles shown within Firehose and they remain the property of their original authors/publishers.

All articles sourced within firehose are from high quality sources as they update often they can't be shown here but to see the list of all
publishers/sources used within firehose, clicking the filter button in the main page of firehose will show the current list of sources; again firehose 
doesn't own or have any relation with the sources used within it. Information about an individual source can be seen by clicking the three dots while 
reading an article and clicking the button that says 'about this source'.

Firehose summaries attempt to give an unbiased summary of the original article; as they are generated by AI they can in rare cases be 
inaccurate, should you notice an article summary with this issue please report the summary.
